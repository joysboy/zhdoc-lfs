  <title>General Compilation Instructions</title>

  <para>When building packages there are several assumptions made within 
  the instructions:</para>

  <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Several of the packages are patched before compilation, but only when
    the patch is needed to circumvent a problem. A patch is often needed in
    both this and the next chapter, but sometimes in only one or the other.
    Therefore, do not be concerned if instructions for a downloaded patch seem
    to be missing.  Warning messages about <emphasis>offset</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>fuzz</emphasis> may also be encountered when applying a patch. Do
    not worry about these warnings, as the patch was still successfully
    applied.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>During the compilation of most packages, there will be several
    warnings that scroll by on the screen. These are normal and can safely be
    ignored.  These warnings are as they appear&mdash;warnings about
    deprecated, but not invalid, use of the C or C++ syntax. C standards change
    fairly often, and some packages still use the older standard. This is not a
    problem, but does prompt the warning.</para>

    <important>
      <para>After installing each package, delete its source and build
      directories, unless specifically instructed otherwise. Deleting the
      sources prevents mis-configuration when the same package is reinstalled
      later.</para>
    </important>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Check one last time that the <envar>LFS</envar> environment variable
    is set up properly:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>echo $LFS</userinput></screen>

    <para>Make sure the output shows the path to the LFS partition's mount
    point, which is <filename class="directory">/mnt/lfs</filename>, using our
    example.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para>Finally, one last important item must be emphasized:</para>

    <important>
      <para>Before issuing the build instructions for a package, the package
      should be unpacked as user <systemitem class="username">lfs</systemitem>,
      and a <command>cd</command> into the created directory should be
      performed.  The build instructions assume that the
      <command>bash</command> shell is in use.</para>
    </important>
  </listitem>
