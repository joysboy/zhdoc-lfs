  <para>My adventures in Linux began in 1998 when I downloaded and
  installed my first distribution. After working with it for a while, I
  discovered issues I definitely would have liked to see improved upon.
  For example, I didn't like the arrangement of the bootscripts or the way
  programs were configured by default. I tried a number of alternative
  distributions to address these issues, yet each had its pros and cons.
  Finally, I realized that if I wanted full satisfaction from my Linux
  system, I would have to build my own from scratch.</para>

  <para>我在 Linux 的冒险开始于 1998 年，当时我下载并安装了我的第一个版本。在使用了一段时间之后，我发现一些问题并且向有所改进。比如，我不喜欢启动脚本的安排或者程序默认的配置方式。我换着使用过很多的版本来解决这些问题，但是每个版本都其优点和缺点。最终，我意识到如果我想要得到完全满足我的 Linux 系统，我就不得不从头开始构建。</para>

<!--E
  <para>What does this mean? I resolved not to use pre-compiled packages
  of any kind, nor CD-ROMs or boot disks that would install basic
  utilities. I would use my current Linux system to develop my own
  customized system. This <quote>perfect</quote> Linux system would then
  have the strengths of various systems without their associated
  weaknesses. In the beginning, the idea was rather daunting, but I
  remained committed to the idea that a system could be built that would
  conform to my needs and desires rather than to a standard that just
  did not fit what I was looking for.</para>
-->
  <para>这意味着什么？我决心不使用任何来自 CD-ROM 或启动磁盘上预先编译好的软件包。我用我现有的 Linux 系统来定制我自己的系统这个<quote>完美的</quote> Linux 系统具有各个 Linux 版本的优点但没有与其具来的弱点。最初，这想法很吓人，但是我仍坚信我能构建一个我需要的系统，我并不是在建立一个符合我需要的标准。</para>

<!--E
  <para>After sorting through issues such as circular dependencies and
  compile-time errors, I created a custom-built Linux system that was
  fully operational and suitable to individual needs. This process also
  allowed me to create compact and streamlined Linux systems which are
  faster and take up less space than traditional operating systems. I
  called this system a Linux From Scratch system, or an LFS system for
  short.</para>
-->
  <para>在处理好例如循环依赖和编译错误等各种问题之后，我创建了一个定制的 Linux 系统，这个系统功能完整并适合个人的需要。这个过程也使得我可以建立精简而紧凑的 Linux 系统，这样的系统比传统的发行版速度更快而且占用的空间更少。我称之为 Linux From Scratch，或简称为 LFS。</para>

<!--E
  <para>As I shared my goals and experiences with other members of the
  Linux community, it became apparent that there was sustained interest
  in the ideas set forth in my Linux adventures. Such custom-built LFS
  systems serve not only to meet user specifications and requirements, but
  also serve as an ideal learning opportunity for programmers and system
  administrators to enhance their Linux skills. Out of this broadened
  interest, the Linux From Scratch Project was born.</para>
-->
  <para>当我把我的成果与经验与 Linux 社区的其他成员分享的时候，很显然其他人对这个想法很感兴趣。这样定制的 LFS 系统不仅可以满足用户的规范和需求，而且也为程序员和系统管理员们提供提高 Linux 技能提供了很好的机会。出于这样广泛的兴趣和需求，Linux From Scratch 项目诞生了。</para>

<!--E
  <para>This <emphasis>Linux From Scratch</emphasis> book provides
  readers with the background and instruction to design and build custom
  Linux systems. This book highlights the Linux from Scratch project and
  the benefits of using this system. Users can dictate all aspects of
  their system, including directory layout, script setup, and security.
  The resulting system will be compiled completely from the source code,
  and the user will be able to specify where, why, and how programs are
  installed. This book allows readers to fully customize Linux systems
  to their own needs and allows users more control over their
  system.</para>
-->
  <para>这本 <emphasis>Linux From Scratch</emphasis> 手册提供了设计和构建 Linux 系统的背景知识和指导，这本书着重于 Linux From Scratch 项目以及使用 LFS 系统的好处。用户可以控制系统的各个方面，包括目录布局、脚本设置、安全设置等。最终的系统完全由源码编译完成。用户可以指定程序安装在哪里，为什么安装以及怎样安装这些程序。本书的读者可以完全定制自己需要的 Linux 系统，并使读者更好的控制自己的系统。 </para>

<!--E
  <para>I hope you will have a great time working on your own LFS
  system, and enjoy the numerous benefits of having a system that is
  truly <emphasis>your own</emphasis>.</para>
-->
  <para>我希望您在自己的 LFS 系统玩的开心，享受完全属于<emphasis>您自己</emphasis>的系统带来的各种便利。</para>
